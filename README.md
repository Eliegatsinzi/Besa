# `Blockchain-Enhanced Serviced Apartments(BESA)` #

A serviced apartment is a type of furnished apartment available for short-term stays(1-5 days), offering amenities and services similar to those found in hotels. Incorporating blockchain technology into serviced apartments can enhance transparency, security, and efficiency. 

Our Blockchain-Enhanced Serviced Apartments DApp aims to build smart contract that will address issues caused by traditional property management systems by leveraging DFINITY's blockchain technology to ensure decentralized, secure, transparent, and immutable transactions.
Also this smart contract will generate passcode automatically once the participant in our Dapp network is granted access according to his/her desired stay days.
